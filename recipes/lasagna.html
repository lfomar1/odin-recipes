      You can easily lighten up lasagna and save a decent amount of dollars by
      using cottage cheese instead of ricottaâ€”you still get that same taste and
      comfort, but it's not as overwhelmingly filling and can be much easier to
      digest for people with minor dairy sensitivities. Blend the cottage cheese
      with a mixer beforehand so it'll have a consistency closer to ricotta.
